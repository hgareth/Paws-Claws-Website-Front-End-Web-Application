# Paws-Claws-Website-Front-End-Web-Application

This project is the first step toward a responsive, multi-page pet adoption website that allows users to browse available animals, submit pets for adoption, and access care information. Built using **HTML5**, **CSS**, and optionally **Bootstrap or W3CSS**, the project emphasizes structured layout, clean design, and future extensibility.

## üìê Layout Structure

The website layout is divided into four consistent sections, designed to remain uniform across all pages:

- **Header**  
  Includes the site name and a logo or image that links back to the home page.

- **Side Menu**  
  A fixed menu on the left or right side of every page with navigation links to:
  - Home
  - Browse Available Pets
  - Find a Dog/Cat
  - Dog Care
  - Cat Care
  - Have a Pet to Give Away
  - Contact Us

- **Content Area**  
  Displays the main information of each page, such as forms, instructions, or descriptions.

- **Footer**  
  Styled with a distinct background color, it includes a link to a Privacy/Disclaimer page.
